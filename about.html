                    I'm interested in coding because i find coding to be super useful in todays world, its an awesome tool that you can create websites, programs and other stuff with, I'm also a very analytical person and coding is the best way that an analytical person can create things with, also from what i learned untill this point in time its very fun to understand how code works, than using it and seeing the thing you wanted to create come to life.
